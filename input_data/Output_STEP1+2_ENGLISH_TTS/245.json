That means police using the tool can only draw out unencrypted files and some metadata, such as file sizes and folder structures. Previously, GrayKey used brute forcing techniques to guess passcodes and had found a way to get around Apples protections preventing such repeat guesses. But no more. And if its impossible for GrayKey, which counts an ex-Apple security engineer among its founders, its a safe assumption few can break iPhone passcodes. Police officer Captain John Sherwin of the Rochester Police Department in Minnesota said of the claim iOS 12 was preventing GrayKey from unlocking iPhones: Thats a fairly accurate assessment as to what we have experienced.

The kernel is the core part of the operating system, from which the rest of iOS launches. Configuration profiles typically allow individuals and companies to customize the ways in which iOS apps work. Grayshift could do without any hiccups. Its just gone global.
